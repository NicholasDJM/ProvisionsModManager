We should use WAL (https://hevodata.com/learn/write-ahead-logging/) on every file write operation, especially when downloading mods and compiling a mod archive.

Setting launch paremeters
1. access `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\config.vdf`
2. search for `"Accounts"`
3. skip to `"SteamID"`
4. save number (SteamID 64)
5. repeat steps 3 & 4 until we find two consecutive closing curly brackets (ignoring white space)
6. access all `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\**\localconfig.vdf`
7. search each userdata configs for number(s) saved in step 4
8. if the same number is found in multiple configs???
8.1  if the number isn't found in any configs, ask user to select their name
8.1.1 present `"PersonaName"` as found in localconfig.vdf under `"friends"`
9. note folder number as SteamID 3
10. search for (in order) `"Software"`, then `"440"`, `"LaunchOptions"`
11. Save next string until `"\n`
12. Add `-insert_search_path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\provisions\load\provisions_dir.vpk"`
13. Save back to localconfig.vdf (split?)
14. ???
15. Profit!
	"Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Valve\Steam\ActiveProcess\ActiveUser" could be used. But only on Windows.

Changing localconfig.vdf doesn't apply the launch paremeters until steam is restarted.
restart with these two commands. look for steam.exe between both commands.
steam://exit
steam://open/main
