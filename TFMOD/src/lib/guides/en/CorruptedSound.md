# Corrupted / Broken Sound
Follow this guide if you hear loud static in game.

## Why does this happen?
- A mod's sound files may be incorrectly created.
- The game may self-corrupt its cache of sounds.

## Possible Fixes
Follow these steps in order.
1. Restart the game, Provisions Mod Loader will automatically clear any sound caches, forcing the game to recreate those sound caches, uncorrupted.
2. Disable any recently installed mods, and restart the game.
	- If you no longer hear the static, contact the mod author and tell them their audio files are broken.
	- Continue disabling mods, one at a time, until the noise goes away.

If this doesn't fix the issue, check your connection of your headphones or speakers, make sure its a secure connection, and not loose.
Lower the volume on your computer.
