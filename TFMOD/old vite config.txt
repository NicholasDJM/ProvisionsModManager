/* Decided against using stylify. It doesn't support stylelint, and actually deletes work.
	When building the application, stylify is called twice, first, it's successfully mangles source files, and generates a matching css file.
	On its second call, it finds no applicable styles in the source files (due to the selectors being already mangled.),
		and deletes everything in the already generated css file.

	Also, it becomes un-maintainable after a point when all the rules are on a single line (Also looks ugly).
